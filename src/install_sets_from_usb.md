# Install sets from USB

When it asks `Which disk is the root disk`, you can press `?` to list all the
physical disks in your computer, then markdown the `USB` install media one (
e.g. `sd1`).

When asking `Location of sets?`, type `disk`.

When asking `Is the disk partition already mounted?` type `no`

When asking `Which disk contains the install media?` type `sd1` (the disk name you markdown before)

So you should be able to install sets via `disk`:)
